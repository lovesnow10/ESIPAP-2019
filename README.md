## Slides

The slides for the lectures will appear in [this directory](Slides) as soon as the course proceeds.

## Exercises

If you have a CERN account, you can run the notebooks on SWAN. Click the button to open a session and import the repository:

<a href="https://cern.ch/swanserver/cgi-bin/go/?projurl=https://github.com/marcodelmastro/ESIPAP-2019.git" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="http://swanserver.web.cern.ch/swanserver/images/badge_swan_white_150.png" />

Otherwise, launch the standalone bind the the button below. It will give you a working environment with Python and ROOT that will allow you to run the notebooks from the browser:

Otherwise, if you have a local version of ROOT (with Python enables) and Python installed, simply clone or download the repository and run the notebooks on you computer.

Go to the Test directory and try to execute the example to verufy your setup.
