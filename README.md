# ESIPAP-2019 - Experimental Particle Physics

## Slides

The slides for the lectures will appear in [this directory](Slides) as soon as the course proceeds.

## Analysis exercise

At some point, we will make a simple analysis exercise. We will use [ROOT](https://root.cern) and [Python](https://www.python.org) with a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebook.

If you have a CERN account, you can run the notebook on [SWAN](http://swan.web.cern.ch). Click the button below to open a session and import the repository. Otherwise, launch the standalone [binder](https://mybinder.org) using the other button below. It will give you a working environment with Python and ROOT that will allow you to run the notebooks from the browser. Of course, if you have a local version of Python and ROOT (with Python enabled) installed, simply clone or download the repository and run the notebooks on you computer. Ask me if you want help!

Go to the [Test](Test) directory and try to execute the example notebook there to verify your setup.
